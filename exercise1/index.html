		<h1> How to do if you have too many pets? </h1>
		<p>Do you have trouble knowing when enough pets is enough? Well, worry no more -- some possible ideas are outlined below.</p>
		<ol>
			<div id="The steps">
			<li>Steps:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Try to counting how many pets you have.</strong></li>
					<p> If you can't count them, or lose count, you probably have too many pets.</p>

					<br><br>
					<li><strong>Test yourself, and your friends/family, to see if you guys can remember your pets names.</strong></li>
					<p> If you guys can't remember them, and you have a good memory, you probably have too many pets.</p>

					<br><br>
					<li><strong>Try to remember which pets you have taken care of on a certain day, and make time to take care of them all.</strong></li>
					<p>You should always remember to take care of your pets. If you don't have time to take care of them all, or don't remember which ones you have taken care of that day, you may have to get rid of some of them. Consider an animal shelter or if you have a friend/family member that may want the pet.</p>

					<br><br>
					<li><strong>See how much money you are spending on your pets monthly or yearly.</strong></li>
					<p>If you are spending too much money on food, toys, bedding, accessories, new cages, etc., you may not be able to afford many pets.</p>

					<br><br>
					<li><strong>You will know if you have too many pets when you don't have any more room for another single pet.</strong></li>
					<p>You should have enough room for each pet rather than being cramped with many pets in a single room.</p>

					<br><br>
					<li><strong>See how long it takes you each day to care for all the animals.</strong></li>
					<p>If it takes over 2-3 hours, then you probably have too many pets to take care of.</p>
