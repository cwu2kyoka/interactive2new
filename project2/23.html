His underwear is hanging on the lamp.
His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.</a></li> </ul>

        <li> <a href ="...">His workbook is wedged in the window,
His sweater's been thrown on the floor.
His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV,
And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.</a></li></ul>

<div id="p3">
      <ul id="navigation"><li> <a href="...">His books are all jammed in the closet,His vest has been left in the hall.
A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed,
And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall. </a></li></ul>
