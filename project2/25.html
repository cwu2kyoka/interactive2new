<p>His underwear is hanging on the lamp.</p>
<p>His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.</p></div>

<div id="p2">
<p>His workbook is wedged in the window,
His sweater's been thrown on the floor.</p>
<p>His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV,
And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3">
  <div class="animate">
<p> His books are all jammed in the closet,</p><p>His vest has been left in the hall.</p>
<p>A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed,</p>
<p>And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall.</p>

Donald or Robert or Willie or Huh? <p>You say it's mine? </p> <p>Oh, dear,I knew it looked familiar!</p>
