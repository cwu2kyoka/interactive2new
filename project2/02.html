	<p> Messy Room</p>
  
  <p>
  	Whosever room this is should be &nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed&nbsp;&nbsp;!</p>
<p>His underwear is &nbsp;&nbsp; hanging &nbsp;&nbsp;  on the lamp.</p>
<p>His raincoat is there in the &nbsp;&nbsp;overstuffed &nbsp;&nbsp; chair,And the chair is becoming quite &nbsp;&nbsp;mucky&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;damp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His workbook is &nbsp;&nbsp; wedged &nbsp;&nbsp;in the window,
His sweater's been &nbsp;&nbsp; thrown &nbsp;&nbsp;on the floor.</p>
<p>His scarf and one ski are &nbsp;&nbsp; beneath &nbsp;&nbsp; the TV,
And his pants have beencarelessly &nbsp;&nbsp;hung &nbsp;&nbsp; on the door.</p>
<p>His books are all &nbsp;&nbsp;jammed &nbsp;&nbsp;in the closet,His vest has been &nbsp;&nbsp;left &nbsp;&nbsp;in the hall.</p>
<p>A lizard named Ed is &nbsp;&nbsp;asleep &nbsp;&nbsp;in his bed,
And his smelly old sock has been &nbsp;&nbsp;stuck &nbsp;&nbsp;to the wall.</p>
<p>Whosever room this is should be &nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed!&nbsp;&nbsp;
Donald or Robert or Willie or Huh? You say it's mine? Oh, dear,I knew it looked familiar!
